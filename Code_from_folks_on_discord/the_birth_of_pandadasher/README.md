# The Birth of PandaDasher 
My wip PandaDasher lib came about when someone on a discord help channel asked the following question:

>Hey! Could someone help me plot a multiline graph using dash? (data is from a dataframe)Information: I have a dataframe that has columns ['date', 'name', 'brand', 'retailer', 'price', 'stars', 'category', 'highlights']. I would like to plot the different brands by date to show price changes over time. Eventually I would also like to include a dropdown menu so a user can choose a specific category to look at (i can provide a screenshot of part of the dataframe if that's helpful)

The file mulplo.py is what I started writing to help them before I decided to make it into an [actual project](https://github.com/Phillyclause89/PandaDasher)
