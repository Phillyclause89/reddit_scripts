## Post Title:
  > On the subject of: Efficiency
  
## Post Body:
  > Hey guys,
  >
  > I've been learning Python, hence why I'm here, and I had a thought run through my mind. Today I made a very short game and simple text game using a single while loop and some if/elif statements. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and you try and guess it, it tells you if you're warmer/colder, etc...
  >
  > The Udemy course I'm following suggested to build the project on my own and compare it to the code they wrote.
  >
  > Now I'm assuming that the dude teaching the course knows quite a bit about the language (maybe that's just wishful thinking) but his code is only 19 lines and does the same thing as my 24 line game, just in a more compact way. My question is this:
  >
  > Do you learn more efficient ways of doing things by experience or by hearing it from others? Is there an advantage to shorter programs vs. long ones? Does it really matter, that 5 line difference?
  >
  > I'm sure this question is all over the place here and elsewhere, but I was just curious some more experienced answers. I'm far from expecting to write elegant code in a weeks worth of learning, but am curious whether or not I should be keeping that idea on the backburner while I'm practicing.
  >
  > Thank you for the hopefully eventual responses!
  > 
  > I put my code in the pastebin.
  > The "solution" the dude gave is in a Jupyter Notebook and so that would be a little bit difficult to pull out.
  >
  > My count was off because I added a few things just to try and learn some things on my own. Other than that it is fairly similar to my original.
