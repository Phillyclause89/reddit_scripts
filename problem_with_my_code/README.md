### My Comment(s):
  > Oh la la. Spanish Python! Give me a moment. Will plug this into Google translate when I get home in a few minutes.
  > Edit: Apologies if it happens to be Portuguese Python. I canâ€™t tell the difference.
  > I'm sure when i refresh the page someone will have beat me to answer by now, but here is a video of how one can use Pycharm's debugger to solve this problem. I'm sure all other IDE's out there have a similar feature.
